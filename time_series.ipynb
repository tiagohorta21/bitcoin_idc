    "### TS are discrete chronological sequences\n",
    "So, a TS is characterized for being:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Sequence__: a TS is a collection of data points. Each data point can have multiple value, although most of the time it is a single value (usually a binary, an integer, or a real value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Discrete__: Although the phenomena measured by a system can be continuous (for example, the outside temperature is a continuous variable because time can \"span the entire real number line\"), TS data is generated by systems that capture data points at specific intervals (for instance, a temperature sensor can take a new temperature reading every 5 minutes). The measurement interval is usually regular (the data points are evenly spaced in time), but they are frequently irregular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Chronologically__: The data points are naturally ordered in time. If you analyze your TS data, in almost all cases, you will notice that data points that are close together in time are more closely related than observations that are further apart. Because of this natural ordering, any time series model will typically attempt to learn from past values of a given sequence."

    "### Level, trend, seasonality, and noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis offers a collection of methods for comprehending a dataset better. Perhaps the of the most beneficial way to analyze a time series is to decompose it into its four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __level__ component represents the series' starting point if it followed a straight line trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __trend__ component describes the series' potentially linear, variable, increasing, or decreasing behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __seasonality__ component identifies the cyclical or recurring patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __noise__ component represents the optional variation in the observations that the model cannot explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **trend and seasonality are optional, and all time series have a level and noise**, i.e., not all time series have a clear trend or seasonality. Some time series may have a stable level and show no trend or seasonality at all. Similarly, the level and noise components are present in almost all time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **level component** represents the baseline or starting point of the series, while the **noise component** captures the random variation or fluctuations in the data that cannot be attributed to any of the other components (such as trend or seasonality).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the level and noise components are fundamental to any time series analysis, while trend and seasonality are additional components that may or may not be present, depending on the nature of the data being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A **cyclic time series** is a time series that exhibits repeating patterns that are not of a fixed frequency. The duration of these patterns is usually more than a year."

    "### Forecasting types\n",
    "\n",
    "Times series forecasting is the process of predicting future values of a time series dataset. Generally, forecasting a time series can now be divided into two categories: __univariate TS forecasting__ and __multivariate TS forecasting__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Univariate time series forecasting\n",
    "- __Univariate time series forecasting__ refers to the process of predicting future values of a __single variable over time__, based on its past values. In other words, it involves analyzing a time series dataset that contains only one variable and using it to make predictions about its future behavior. Univariate time series forecasting methods typically involve identifying the underlying patterns or components of the time series, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and then using statistical models to make predictions about future values based on these patterns. Some common univariate time series forecasting techniques include exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and seasonal decomposition of time series models. These methods can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts, depending on the nature of the data and the forecasting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, predicting the daily closing price of a stock based on its past prices is a univariate time series forecasting problem. In this case, the time series dataset contains only one variable (the daily closing price of the stock) and the goal is to predict its future values based on its past values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multivariate time series forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Multivariate time series forecasting__ refers to the process of predicting future values of __multiple variables over time__, based on their past values and potential relationships among them. In other words, it involves analyzing a time series dataset that contains multiple variables and using them together to make predictions about their future behavior. Multivariate time series forecasting methods typically involve identifying the underlying patterns or components of the time series for each variable, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and then using statistical models that can account for the __interactions among these variables to make joint predictions about their future behavior__. Some common multivariate time series forecasting techniques include vector autoregression (VAR) models, dynamic factor models, and neural network models. These methods also can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts, depending on the nature of the data and the forecasting problem. Multivariate time series forecasting is often used in fields such as economics, finance, and environmental science, where multiple variables are known to interact and influence each other over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, predicting the daily closing price of a stock based on its past prices and other variables such as the daily closing prices of other stocks in the same industry is a multivariate time series forecasting problem. In this case, the time series dataset contains multiple variables (the daily closing prices of the stocks) and the goal is to predict their future values based on their past values and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, __exogenous variables__ are external variables that are not part of the time series being analyzed, but are believed to have an influence on the dependent variable in the time series. In other words, exogenous variables are considered to be factors that are outside of the system being modeled but still impact the outcome of the system. In time series analysis, exogenous variables are often included in the model as additional predictors or inputs to improve the accuracy of the forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in economic forecasting, exogenous variables such as interest rates, inflation rates, and government policies may be included in the model to improve the accuracy of the forecast for a particular economic indicator. Exogenous variables are often distinguished from __endogenous variables__, which are variables that are part of the time series being analyzed and are affected by other variables in the system."

    "### Questions before doing forecastings\n",
    "\n",
    "Before embarking on a TS forecasting project, it is important to consider several key questions to ensure that the analysis is appropriate for the data and the problem at hand. Some questions to ask before doing time series forecasting include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the goal of the analysis, and what decisions or actions will be based on the forecasted values?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the time period and frequency of the data being analyzed, and is it stationary (i.e., do the statistical properties of the data remain consistent over time)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the underlying patterns or components of the time series, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and how can they be accounted for in the forecasting model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What variables or factors might be influencing the time series that are not included in the data, and how can these exogenous variables be incorporated into the forecasting model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the appropriate forecasting horizon for the problem at hand, and what level of accuracy is required for the forecasted values?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much data do you have at your disposal, and can you compile it all?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are projections subject to regular revision over time, or must they only be created once and remain unchanged? Forecasts that are updated as new data becomes available frequently produce more precise predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How frequently should forecasts be made? Forecasts can frequently be generated at lower or higher frequencies, enabling you to take use of down- and up-sampling of data, which can be advantageous for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By answering these questions, analysts can ensure that they are using appropriate methods and models for the time series forecasting problem, and that the resulting forecasts are reliable and actionable.\n"

    "### Types of time series\n",
    "As already mentioned, there are different types of TS that can be categorized based on various characteristics of the data. Here are some of the most common types of time series:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Trend time series__: A trend TS is a type of time series that exhibits a long-term trend or pattern over time, which can be increasing or decreasing. Trend time series are commonly observed in economic, financial, and demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Seasonal time series__: A seasonal time series is a type of time series that exhibits regular patterns or cycles over time, such as daily, weekly, or yearly seasonality. Examples of seasonal time series include monthly sales data for a retailer, daily temperature readings, or hourly electricity demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Cyclical time series__: A cyclical time series is a type of time series that exhibits cycles or fluctuations over time, but the cycles do not have a fixed length or regular pattern. Cyclical time series are often observed in economic and financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Irregular time series__: An irregular time series is a type of time series that does not exhibit any specific patterns or trends, and the data appears to be random or unpredictable. Irregular time series are often observed in data that is subject to random noise or measurement errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Event time series__: An event time series is a type of time series that represents the occurrence or frequency of specific events over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Spatio-temporal time series__: A spatio-temporal time series is a type of time series that includes data on both time and space. This type of data is often used in environmental and geographical research to study the changes in environmental variables over time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These different types of time series may require different mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze and model, depending on the nature of the data and the research questions being asked."
